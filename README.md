# glitchlands
 Mini platformer metroidvania

Just a game I made in my free time. Let me know if you experience any issues.

See more details and download for Windows on Itch: https://codefizz.itch.io/glitchlands


### How to run

Open `glitchlands.py` or run `python glitchlands.py` in the console. If you don't know how to do this, you should probably just download the executable from Itch.


### Command line arguments

`-s`, `--slot` - Launch the game immediately into the specified save file. 0-3 for slots 1-4, -1 to disable saving.


### Level editor

Yes, I made a level editor for this game. It's not good by any means but if you feel like playing around with the levels for some reason, go ahead and run `glitchlands_editor.py`. Access the controls and shortcuts from the help menu within the editor. Note that the editor is not able to modify some obscure parameters because I was lazy (such as a level's warp_* attributes and the NPC's tooltip position).
